      <h2>About</h2>
      <h1>Hey, I'm Tony</h1>
      <p>I began my web development journey in earnest by joining Free Code Camp in March of 2015. As with most newbies, I continually look for the best path to take in my quest for coding knowledge. In the fall of 2015, I made a change and started down the Rails path, thinking I had finally found the best past at last. I did learn alot during the 3-4 months I spent with Rails. However, I realized that the Rails path I was on did not have a clearly defined path like FCC laid out with their learning path and end goals. After looking thru the updated curriculum Quincy Larson and team had pushed up in December 2015 and January 2016, I realized the path I was on originally was the best path for me. So in January, of this year 2016, I made a committment to begin working thru the FCC curriculum again. I realize it's going to be hard at times (actually it already has been at times) but my plan is to complete as much of the curriculum as I can in 2016.</p>
