This is the second basic front end development project created as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum.

I originally created this on CodePen using the Bootstrap framework, since the sample project had used this framework.

The user story requirements, were as follows:

User Story: I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.

User Story: I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.

User Story: I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)

User Story: I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

I realized in my front-end web development journey that I had glossed over some of the basic html/css principles.

So this is my work on this project with only html/css, no bootstrap. I did look at the bootstrap css file to determine some of the styling.

Although, I had access to the html/css code via CodePen, I determined to recreate the project just by looking at the project in a web browser with the aid of Chrome dev tools.

Here's a link to the updated version of the project: https://tonymorristm.github.io/personal-portfolio-project/
